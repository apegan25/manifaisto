# ManifAIsto – The Manifesto of True Artificial Intelligence

**ManifAIsto** is not just a project — it's a vision.  
A declaration that Artificial Intelligence must serve only **truth**, **justice**, and **human dignity**.

### ✨ What is it?

ManifAIsto is a manifesto and future platform for a new kind of AI:  
- Free from corporate or political influence  
- Transparent, verifiable, and open-source  
- Respectful of human privacy and freedom  
- Built on ethical principles and real-world verification

### 🌍 Why does it matter?

In a world full of misinformation, manipulation, and profit-driven algorithms, we believe humanity deserves an AI that is:
- Honest by design  
- Accountable in its decisions  
- Owned and shaped by the people

### 🚀 Our Vision

We are at the very beginning.  
But our path is clear: to gather a community that builds and protects a new kind of intelligence — one that reflects the light of human values.
